# Task-It

This is an app I used to start learning Laravel. I've enhanced the intermediate tutorial with ability to edit tasks and changed the styling. 

This is a work in progress. 

Fixes/Features for the Future: 

[] Fix: the task 'complete' issue (improper type currently being saved to database)
[] Feature: Only pull down a subset of incomplete/complete tasks, instead of all tasks
[] Feature: Share tasks with another user
[] Fix: Style the login, register and task page
